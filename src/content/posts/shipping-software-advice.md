This is the best piece of advice I've ever received about building software.

> If you're not embarrassed by the thing you shipped, you waited too long

When people first hear this, they think it means shipping buggy code. It isn't.

It's also not about shipping broken experiences.

The mindset revolves around the idea that you'll learn what you need to build when your customers first start using it. If you wait until you have a full-featured, polished application there's a good chance you've waisted time building the wrong thing.

Figure out what your MVP is and ship it two weeks early.

Talk with customers and see if it resonates. Get comfortable shipping early and often.

Iterate and repeat. Happy shipping! 🚢
