When it comes to hosting a website, choosing the right platform is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, security, and scalability. Recently, I decided to migrate mckerlie.com from Vercel to Cloudflare. Both platforms offer exceptional services, but the move to Cloudflare was driven by a need for enhanced performance, deeper control over security, and an integrated suite of tools that could grow with the site’s needs. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the decision-making process, the steps involved in the migration, and the benefits I’ve experienced since making the switch.

## Why Cloudflare?

Before diving into the migration process, it's important to understand why Cloudflare became the preferred choice for hosting mckerlie.com. While Vercel is known for its developer-friendly features and seamless integration with modern frameworks, Cloudflare offers a broader range of services that align more closely with the long-term goals for the site.

Performance Optimization: Cloudflare’s global network is designed to deliver content at lightning speed. With its extensive network of data centers, Cloudflare ensures that content is served from the location closest to the user, reducing latency and improving load times.

Security: As cyber threats continue to evolve, having robust security measures in place is non-negotiable. Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection provide an added layer of security, protecting mckerlie.com from malicious attacks.

Edge Computing: Cloudflare’s Workers platform enables the execution of custom code at the edge, allowing for more dynamic and personalized content delivery. This was a key factor in the decision to migrate, as it opens up new possibilities for future development.

Cost Efficiency: While Vercel is cost-effective for smaller projects, Cloudflare’s pricing structure offers more flexibility and potential cost savings as the site scales, particularly with the inclusion of services like DNS management and caching.

## Migrating

Migrating a website from one hosting provider to another can seem daunting, but with careful planning, it can be a smooth process. Here’s how I transitioned mckerlie.com from Vercel to Cloudflare:

1. Preparation
   Backup: Before making any changes, I backed up the entire site, including the database, media files, and all configurations. This step is crucial to avoid data loss in case anything goes wrong during the migration.
   DNS Settings: I reviewed the existing DNS settings on Vercel and documented them. Since Cloudflare offers DNS management, this step ensured a seamless transition without downtime.
2. Setting Up Cloudflare
   Account Setup: I created a Cloudflare account and added mckerlie.com to the dashboard. Cloudflare’s setup wizard made this process straightforward, automatically importing DNS records from Vercel.
   SSL Configuration: Cloudflare provides free SSL certificates, so I configured the SSL settings to ensure that the site remained secure during and after the migration.
   Caching and Page Rules: I customized caching settings and created specific page rules to optimize the delivery of content and improve load times.
3. Deploying the Site
   Transfer Codebase: I deployed the site’s codebase to Cloudflare Workers Sites, which allows for static site hosting directly on Cloudflare’s edge network. This step involved minor adjustments to the build process but was overall straightforward.
   Testing: Once the site was live on Cloudflare, I performed extensive testing to ensure that all functionalities worked as expected. This included checking links, forms, and third-party integrations.
4. Final Steps
   DNS Switchover: I pointed the domain’s DNS settings to Cloudflare’s nameservers. This is a critical step as it completes the migration process, directing all traffic to the new hosting environment.
   Monitor and Optimize: After the migration, I closely monitored the site’s performance using Cloudflare’s analytics tools. I also fine-tuned settings like cache purging and firewall rules to optimize performance and security further.
   Benefits Realized Post-Migration
   Since moving mckerlie.com to Cloudflare, I’ve noticed several immediate benefits:

Faster Load Times: The site loads significantly faster, thanks to Cloudflare’s global content delivery network and efficient caching mechanisms.
Improved Security: The WAF and DDoS protection have added an extra layer of security, giving me peace of mind that the site is protected against common threats.
Enhanced Scalability: With Cloudflare Workers, I now have the flexibility to implement advanced features at the edge, making it easier to scale the site as needed.
Conclusion
The decision to migrate mckerlie.com from Vercel to Cloudflare was not made lightly, but the benefits have far outweighed the challenges. Cloudflare’s comprehensive suite of tools and global infrastructure provide a robust foundation for the site’s future growth. Whether you’re considering a similar move or just exploring hosting options, I highly recommend evaluating Cloudflare’s offerings—they might be the perfect fit for your project, just as they have been for mine.
