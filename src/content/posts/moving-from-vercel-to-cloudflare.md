If there's one common trait I've seen between engineers it's the constant desire to tinker and improve. Last year I move this site from [Hugo to Astro](/posts/migrating-your-blog-from-hugo-to-astro/) purely because I wanted to try a new framework out. This year I decided to move from hosting it with Vercel to Cloudflare mainly because I was getting more and more concerned about the [billing horror stories](https://x.com/zemotion/status/1798558292681343039). I've used Cloudflare for a number of years to mitigate DDoS attacks but I've never hosted an entire site. An added bonus of moving was that I also got to use [counterscale](https://github.com/benvinegar/counterscale) as a free self-hosted analytics provider.
